# SnakeGame
The classic SnakeGame implemented in several lanuages to become more confortable with each
the idea is that i can first implement it in a language i am quite familar with (python, rust), 
and then rewrite it in languages im less comfortable with, (java),
 and then start implementing it into languages i want to learn (kotlin,scala,go)
 and then finally rewrite it in languages i am scared of, C and Haskell.

each language will follow the same spec, that of the classic SnakeGame, with graphics implemented in both TUI and GUI.
The GUI library will be chosen based on the most popular GUI library for each language, (eg. turtle for python.)

There will also be documentation files which can be used to read about the notable differences between implementations likely due to language restrictions.
