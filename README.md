# SnakeGame
The classic SnakeGame implemented in several lanuages to become more confortable with each
the idea is that i can first implement it in a language i am quite familar with (python, rust), 
and then rewrite it in languages im less comfortable with, (java),
 and then start implementing it into languages i want to learn (kotlin,scala,go)
 and then finally rewrite it in languages i am scared of, C and Haskell.
